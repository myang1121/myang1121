## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m an undergraduate junior in **Electrical & Computer Engineering** (minor in Mechanical Engineering) at Cornell University.  

## About Me ⭐️
I have hands‑on experience in:
- **FPGA prototyping & RTL development**
- **Embedded C/C++ programming** on microcontrollers (FRDM‑KL46Z, Arduino UNO, etc.)
- **Linux‑based systems** & **RISC‑V architectures**

## Leadership ☀️
As the **team lead** of Solar Panel Reboot, a student project team at Cornell University, I aspire to become an engineer who designs technologies that matter, with sustainability at heart. 

During my three years with Solar Panel Reboot, I oversaw the design and led the execution of the refurbishment project. I represented my team and presented our work at the EUCI Solar Panel Recycling Conference, and our project earned the Student Sustainability Award of the Year at our university. 

Following the completion of the refurbishment project last spring, my team shifted our focus to solar panel cooling. Solar panels generate electricity more efficiently in cooler temperatures than in hotter ones, so in regions where sunlight is abundant but temperatures are extreme—such as Africa and the Middle East—the outcomes of our project could prove particularly beneficial. 

Currently, my team is constructing a solar simulator test bench to support a PhD research group developing a digital solar twin for agrivoltaic applications. ​

## Technical Skills 🧰
- **Languages & Frameworks:** C, C++, Java, Python, Verilog, ARM Assembly, MATLAB  
- **Hardware & Tools:** FPGA, RTL modeling & testing, Embedded Linux, CAD (Fusion 360), PCB design (KiCad)  
- **Web & Software:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Language 🌎
- **Mandarin Chinese** Native proficiency (spoken & written)
- **English** Native proficiency (spoken & written)
- **Japanese** Intermediate proficiency  (2 years college-level), planning to take JLPT N2 in December 2025
- **French** Advanced Beginner proficiency (3 years high school level)

## Design & Media 📸
- **Photography:** Student photographer for Cornell Student & Campus Life and Residence Hall Association  
- **Graphic Design:** Logos, merchandise, promotional flyers  
- **Social Media:** Content creation & management  
- **Tools:** Adobe After Effects, Photoshop, Lightroom Classic, Illustrator

## Recent Projects 🚀
- **Cube Collecting Robot**  
  Collaborating with two teammates as the “Circuit Breakers,” we designed and built an autonomous robot for the “Cube Craze” competition to collect and stack cubes

- **FRDM‑KL46Z Tilt‑Controlled RC Car**  
  My FRDM‑KL46Z board reads tilt via its onboard accelerometer, transmits orientation data over UART to a Bluetooth module on an RC car, and controls the steering servo in real time

## Passion & Goals 🔧🤖
I want to build **robots** that enhance everyday life for elders, children, and those in need. My vision isn’t factory automation, but robots as household members, classroom aides, and trusted companions. Think PARO or Pepper, robots optimized for human interaction, with ability to read emotions, recognize faces, and have conversations. I vision a society where robots and humans co-exist. Like Japanese mangas I read growing up, robots that are protrayed as companions (heros even), performing assigned tasks harmoniously within human society.
